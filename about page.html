        <h2>Why This Website Was Created</h2>
        <p><strong>BMW M3 Legacy</strong> was developed as a comprehensive and educational website project by a tertiary-level student in the BSc Applied Business Computing programme. This site was created for the Web Development module to demonstrate both technical web design skills and a deep appreciation for automotive innovation.</p>

        <p>The core purpose of this website is to explore and present the legacy of the BMW M3 — a vehicle line renowned for its connection to motorsport, exceptional engineering, and influence on performance vehicle culture. By combining text, visuals, and interactive elements such as slideshows and a feedback form, the site aims to offer a meaningful experience for visitors of various backgrounds — whether they are automotive enthusiasts, casual browsers, or students conducting research.</p>

        <p>The BMW M3 has evolved through six major generations since its introduction in 1986, and each one has played a significant role in shaping the expectations for what a performance sedan should be. Through this website, users can learn about each generation's unique characteristics, special editions, and technical innovations. The aim is not only to educate but also to inspire interest in automotive history, design, and technology.</p>
